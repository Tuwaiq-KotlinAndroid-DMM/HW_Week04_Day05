# What you'll do 📋
## You'll learn how to design and construct an app using the architecture components Room. Your app will:
- work with a database to get and save data, and pre-populate the database with sample words.
- display all the words in a `RecyclerView` in the `MainActivity` class.
- open a second activity when the user taps the + button. When the user enters a word, that word is added to the database and displayed in the `RecyclerView` list.

## The app is no-frills, but sufficiently complex that you can use it as a template to build upon. Here's a preview:
